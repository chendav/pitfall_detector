# Contributing to AI Pitfall Detector

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AI Pitfall Detector! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms:

- üêõ **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- üí° **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- üîç **Tool Detection**: Add support for new AI tools and frameworks
- üìù **Documentation**: Improve guides, examples, and explanations

- üåê **Integrations**: Create plugins for IDEs, CI/CD systems, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (3.9+ recommended)
- Git
- pip or conda

### Local Development Environment

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-pitfall-detector.git
cd ai-pitfall-detector

# 3. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# 4. Install in development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# 5. Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pre-commit install

# 6. Verify installation
ai-pitfall --help
```

### Development Dependencies

The `[dev]` extra includes:
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Test coverage reporting
- **black**: Code formatting
- **flake8**: Code linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pre-commit**: Git hook framework

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=pitfall_detector --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_analyzer.py -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_static_rules.py::TestStaticConflictDetector::test_detect_env_conflicts -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Test functions should be named `test_*`
- Aim for >90% test coverage for new code
- Include both unit and integration tests

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
from pitfall_detector.your_module import YourClass

class TestYourClass:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Setup for each test method."""
        self.instance = YourClass()
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test basic functionality."""
        result = self.instance.your_method()
        assert result == expected_value
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test error conditions."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            self.instance.your_method(invalid_input)
```

## üìù Code Style

### Formatting Standards

We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Format code with black
black pitfall_detector/ tests/

# Check with flake8
flake8 pitfall_detector/ tests/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy pitfall_detector/
```

### Style Guidelines

1. **Code Formatting**: Use `black` with default settings
2. **Line Length**: 88 characters (black default)
3. **Imports**: Use `isort` for import sorting
4. **Type Hints**: Include type hints for all public functions
5. **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
6. **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names, prefer `snake_case`

Example function with proper style:
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def analyze_tool_conflicts(
    tools: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.7
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Analyze conflicts between AI tools.
    
    Args:
        tools: List of tool information dictionaries
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence for reporting conflicts
        
    Returns:
        List of detected conflicts with metadata
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If tools list is empty
    """
    if not tools:
        raise ValueError("Tools list cannot be empty")
    
    conflicts = []
    # Implementation here...
    return conflicts
```

## üîç Adding New Tool Detection

One of the most valuable contributions is adding support for new AI tools. Here's how:

### 1. Update Tools Database

Add your tool to `tools_database.yaml`:

```yaml
your_tool_name:
  name: "Your Tool Name"
  package_names: ["your-tool-package", "alternative-package"]
  github_url: "https://github.com/author/your-tool"
  category: "web-interface"  # or agent-framework, rag-tool, etc.
  default_ports: [8080, 8081]
  common_env_vars: ["YOUR_TOOL_API_KEY", "YOUR_TOOL_CONFIG"]
  description: "Brief description of what this tool does"
  detection_patterns:
    imports: ["your_tool", "from your_tool"]
    classes: ["YourMainClass", "YourSecondaryClass"]
    files: ["your_tool_config.yaml"]
    functions: ["your_tool_main"]
```

### 2. Add Static Conflict Rules

If your tool has known conflicts, add them to the static rules system.

### 3. Test Your Addition

```bash
# Test detection
ai-pitfall scan --project-path /path/to/project/with/your-tool

# Test conflict analysis
ai-pitfall quick-analyze \
  https://github.com/author/your-tool \
  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit
```

### 4. Add Tests

Create tests to verify your tool is detected correctly:

```python
def test_detect_your_tool(self):
    """Test detection of your tool."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### README Updates

When adding significant features:
1. Update the main README.md
2. Add examples of your feature
3. Update the command reference table
4. Include any new configuration options

### Docstring Standards

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def your_function(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> List[str]:
    """Brief description of the function.
    
    Longer description if needed. Explain the purpose and any
    important details about the function's behavior.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of the first parameter
        param2: Description of the second parameter with default
        
    Returns:
        Description of what the function returns
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param1 is empty
        RuntimeError: When operation fails
        
    Example:
        >>> result = your_function("hello", 5)
        >>> print(result)
        ['processed', 'hello', '5']
    """
```
